# 'Ghosts' in LOs
After removing 'Wait' actions, users from that step will still wait their original wait period before moving on/exiting.

During this wait period they are invisible in the UI and API. Not event support can see them.

**Solution:** The only solution is to set the LO to 'inactive' which fully removes everyone from the LO, then switch back to 'active'.
