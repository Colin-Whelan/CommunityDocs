# Locked Hardbounce Status
Once a user is marked as 'hardbounce' there is no natural/automatic way to remove this status. This may be needed if for example a customer hardbounced then changed their email. The act of changing the email to something valid indicates they still wish to receive emails. This can happen for reasons such as a typo or a customized email that stopped being used.

**Solution:** Use the UI to change the status to 'Valid'. **Make sure to preserve the opt-out status.** This is not tracked in any system, it's recommended changes be tracked locally.
